# SSH Server

I'm using [asyncssh](http://asyncssh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) lib to build a ssh server

* ssh_srv.py is the prototype


# Also creating [bastion host](https://cloudacademy.com/blog/aws-bastion-host-nat-instances-vpc-peering-security/) admin tools


* ssh-rev1.py has been used to familiarize with the pexpect library

* rev2 file was to try several commands

* rev3 is to use a RSA key to connect to a distant server

* ag is for an interactive session with ssh. It can used any tools that are interactive lile with ftp or sftp

## The aim is to build a bastion host with prerecorded settings (WIP)
