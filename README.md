# SSH Server

I'm using [asyncssh](http://asyncssh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) lib to build a ssh server

* ssh_srv.py is the prototype


# Also creating some admin tools with the pexpect library that can be found on the folder, *pexpect scripting*


* cmd_ssh.py has been used to familiarize with the pexpect library : is used as a test to connect and run command lines on a distant server 

* conn.py is two methods that I want to build as a library, one method is dealing with sending an uptime to a remote server and the second method is creating a file on a remote server, with some minor interactivity.
