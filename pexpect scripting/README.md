# library pexpect

The aim of using pexpect is not to build the python server, more to build some tools that 
I hope will be used for the python server.

Currently, there are only `cmd_ssh.py`, which represents my first attempt with pexpect and `conn.py`, which is more 
trying to build methods that can be used in a library. One method is dealing with sending an uptime to a remote server 
and the second method is creating a file on a remote server, with some minor interactivity.
